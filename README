Perl iRODS Client Wrapper Library

These modules wrap several iRODS (http://www.irods.org) command line
client programs in a Perl API.

The clients wrapped are the iRODS icommand programs
(https://wiki.irods.org/index.php/icommands) and baton programs
(https://github.com/wtsi-npg/baton).

The Perl library supports messaging with RabbitMQ (https://www.rabbitmq.com)
for notification of method calls.
